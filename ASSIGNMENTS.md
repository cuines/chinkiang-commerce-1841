# Project Kick-off: Transcribe Assigned Ledger Rows

## Transcription Assignment

Welcome to the hands‑on phase of our seminar project. Each of you is assigned a specific block of rows from the Chinkiang customs ledger (July 1841). Your task is to transcribe your assigned rows into the `trade_data.csv` file, following the guidelines in the README.

### Assignments

- **Student A**: Rows 1–10  
- **Student B**: Rows 11–20  
- **Student C**: Rows 21–30  
- **Student D**: Rows 31–40  

### Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** from `main` with your name (e.g., `student-a-transcription`).
3. **Open the `trade_data.csv` file** on your branch and carefully transcribe the data for your assigned rows. Insert the new rows directly below the header row.
4. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message (e.g., “Transcribe rows 1‑10”).
5. **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository. Title the PR “Transcription: Rows X‑Y” (replace X‑Y with your row range).

### Handling Ambiguities

If you encounter an illegible entry or any ambiguity in the original ledger (e.g., a number that could be a 5 or a 6, a commodity name that is partly obscured), **do not guess**. Instead:

1. Create a **new Issue** in this repository with a title like “**Ambiguous Entry in Row 14**”.
2. In the issue body, describe the problem in detail and, if possible, crop and upload a small image of the specific cell from the high‑resolution scan.
3. Leave the corresponding cell in your CSV blank or mark it as `[illegible]` and refer to the issue number.

This ensures that every interpretive decision is documented and can be discussed by the whole group.

### Review Process

Once a Pull Request is opened, all other participants (including me) will review the changes in the “Files changed” tab. We will add inline comments on any suspected errors. Please respond to comments and make corrections as needed.

When all comments are resolved and the transcription is approved, I will merge the PR using a “squash and merge” strategy.

### Deadline

Please aim to complete your transcription and open your Pull Request by **January 15**. This will give us enough time for peer review and merging before the analysis phase begins.

Good luck, and remember: accuracy is more important than speed. If you have any questions about the process, post them as comments on this file (or create an Issue).
